## Hi! Welcome to Bird Migration!

### Intro

This repo will take a look at the migration paths of three birds named Eric, Nico, and Sanne. My team took a look at a variety of different variables among the three trips including distance traveled, speed, altitude, and more. Take a look at [Bird Migration](birdmigration.ipynb) for more!

### How to...

All of the files needed for this analysis are included in the repo. 

1. Download the interative [Bird Migration](birdmigration.ipynb) and [CSV File](bird_tracking.csv)
