# bird-migration

## Hi! Welcome to Bird Migration!

### Intro

This repo will take a look at the migration paths of three birds named Eric, Nico, and Sanne. My team took a look at a variety of different variables among the three trips including distance traveled, speed, altitude, and more. Take a look at [Bird Migration](DATA200BirdProjectFinal.ipynb) for more!

### How to view our analysis..

All of the files needed for this analysis are included in the repo. 

1. Download the interactive [Bird Migration](DATA200BirdProjectFinal.ipynb) and [CSV File](bird_tracking.csv)
2. Run all of the imports (you may have to un-comment the package installs to access some of the imports)
3. Run all of the lines (button up top) and our plots should pop up!

### Note: to view any of the plots, you need to download the ipynb notebook. GitHub does not like widgets/interact functions. You can also view pictures of our plots in the Pictures of Plots folder!
